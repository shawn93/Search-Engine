## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

- The [Java Tutorials - Trail: Collections](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html) section will be useful for understanding different types of collections.

- The [`Collections`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html) class has several helpful methods for this assignment. You might want to check out the `addAll()` and `unmodifiableSet()` methods in particular.

- Most methods are under 5 lines of code (most of that will be `if/else` blocks), and involve calling the appropriate `Map` or `Set` methods. 

You are not required to use these hints in your solution. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
