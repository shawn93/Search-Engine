 * Demonstrates how parameter passing works in Java, including the difference
 * in behavior for immutable versus mutable objects.
 *
 * In particular, mutability is tied to how memory is handled. If new memory
 * is created when you change a value, then the original object is immutable.
 * If the values stored at the original memory location is modified, then it
 * is mutable.
 *
 * This is also related to whether it is "safe" to pass objects, because if
 * it is mutable, other classes can modify its value using that reference!
